# conditional_coconet
This model is based on Magenta/coconet deep learning music generating model. 
It is written in tensorflow.js and a conditional model (hence the name conditional_coconet). It takes chords as inputs and generates melodies. 
To use this model, you need to clone magenta library from here: https://github.com/tensorflow/magenta.
Then, you need to place "conditional_coconet" dir inside "magenta-js/music/src/" folder.
